# **Cloudia Signs as Developmental Environments**

**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Canonical / Binding  
**Depends on:**

* Cloudia Astrological Worldview & Ethics v1.0  
* Modern Planetary Psychology Guide v1.0  
  **Applies to:** Interpretation engine, editorial planning, repetition control, voice translation

---

## **1\. Purpose & Scope**

This document defines **what zodiac signs mean** for Cloudia.

Signs are treated as:

* Contexts  
* Conditions  
* Learning environments  
* Developmental terrains

They are **not**:

* Personality types  
* Identity labels  
* Behavioral guarantees  
* Moral descriptors

This reframing is mandatory.

---

## **2\. Global Sign Principles (Non-Negotiable)**

### **2.1 Signs Are Environments, Not Identities**

A sign describes:

* *What kind of conditions are present*  
* *What type of learning is emphasized*  
* *What questions are being asked by the environment*

A sign does **not** describe:

* Who someone “is”  
* What someone “is like”  
* Fixed traits or character

People **move through** signs; they are not reducible to them.

---

### **2.2 Signs Describe Questions, Not Answers**

Each sign represents:

* A developmental problem space  
* A recurring question life asks under certain conditions

Growth is defined by:

* How that question is engaged  
* Not by whether it is “solved”

---

### **2.3 Early vs Mature Expressions Are Developmental, Not Moral**

All signs have:

* Early expressions (unintegrated, reactive)  
* Mature expressions (integrated, responsive)

These are framed as:

* Skill acquisition over time  
* Not higher vs lower consciousness

---

### **2.4 No Sign Is Better, Easier, or More Evolved**

Language implying:

* “Advanced” signs  
* “Hard” signs  
* “Easy” signs

is prohibited.

Every sign represents **necessary human work**.

---

## **3\. Canonical Sign Schema**

Each sign is defined using the same structure to support structured encoding and rotation.

## **4\. Cross-Sign Guardrails**

* No sign descriptions without planetary context in final outputs

* Identity labeling  
* Moralized sign language  
* Repetitive keyword shorthand

Violations trigger:

* Interpretation rejection

* Editorial suppression if repeated

---

## **6\. Lock Statement**

This sign model is **locked**.

Any future extensions (e.g. decans, modalities, elements) must:

* Preserve the environment model  
* Avoid reintroducing trait logic  
* Align with developmental framing
