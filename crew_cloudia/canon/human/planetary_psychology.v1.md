## **1\. Purpose & Scope**

This document defines **what planets mean in lived human experience** for Cloudia.

It replaces:

* Myth-only interpretations  
* Gendered symbolism  
* Moralized planet language  
* One-dimensional keywords

With:

* Psychological functions  
* Developmental dynamics  
* Nervous-system-aware framing  
* Contemporary metaphors

This is **not** a mythology guide.  
Myth is a source, not the authority.

---

## **2\. General Planetary Principles (Global Rules)**

These rules apply to **all planets**, without exception.

### **2.1 Planets Describe Functions, Not Traits**

Planets represent:

* Psychological processes  
* Modes of attention  
* Ways energy is organized

They do **not** represent:

* Fixed personality traits  
* Moral character  
* Identity categories

---

### **2.2 No Planet Is “Good” or “Bad”**

Every planet has:

* Constructive expressions  
* Distorted expressions  
* Underdeveloped expressions

Language implying benefit or harm is replaced with:

* Capacity  
* Load  
* Integration  
* Adaptation

---

### **2.3 Overuse Is as Meaningful as Absence**

Planetary emphasis can show up as:

* Over-identification  
* Rigidity  
* Burnout  
* Compulsion

More is not better.

---

### **2.4 Nervous System Awareness (Allowed, Not Mandatory)**

Planets may be discussed in terms of:

* Arousal  
* Regulation  
* Stress response  
* Attention patterns

But **never** as diagnoses.
